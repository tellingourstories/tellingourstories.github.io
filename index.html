<p>This is a place for trans people, and probably all other people, to learn from each other. Similar to all the other places that already exist, but just one more option for those still trying to find themselves.</p>

	<p><b>Letter to My Transphobia</b></p>
	    <p>Dear Transphobia,

	You are the voice in my head that constantly reminds me I’m not a real woman. You belittle my looks, my feelings, and my dreams with abandon, only rarely giving me the respites I need to figure out what I want and who I am. You are not me. You were created by society, shaped and molded by its closed minded attitudes and stigmas.  I hate you. But I cannot wholly escape you yet, and perhaps I never truly will. So I’ve decided that the best course of action is not to fight you or rage uselessly against you, but to extend an olive branch of peace and learn to coexist with you and maybe slowly tame you or some shit idk yet yo. </p>
